# CustomerAI Project – Comprehensive Q&A for All Users

This document aggregates common questions and answers for executives, developers, auditors, and end-users regarding CustomerAI’s security, readiness, usage, and operational practices.

---

## For Executives & Stakeholders

### Q1: How secure is CustomerAI?
**A:**
CustomerAI enforces security at every stage: all secrets are required at startup, secret scanning is automated, and sensitive operations use cryptographic best practices. Our containers run as non-root, and CI/CD blocks unsafe changes before they reach production. Security is not an afterthought—it’s built-in.

### Q2: What happens if a developer accidentally commits a secret?
**A:**
Our pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline automatically scan for secrets. If a secret is detected, the commit or PR is blocked and the developer is alerted—preventing leaks before they can happen.

### Q3: How do we know the system is production-ready?
**A:**
We’ve implemented automated linting, testing, coverage enforcement, and security checks. The system fails fast if any critical configuration is missing, and all these checks are enforced for every change. This gives us confidence in both code quality and operational readiness.

### Q4: What’s the plan for scaling or future features?
**A:**
CustomerAI is built for scalability—rate limiting, CORS, and environment-based configs are already in place. Adding new features or scaling up will not compromise our security or compliance posture.

### Q5: What are the remaining risks?
**A:**
No critical risks remain. Minor issues (like redundant Dockerfile instructions) have no impact on security or function. We recommend raising test coverage further and continuing to monitor with automated tools.

## For Developers & Engineers

### Q1: How do I set up the project locally?
**A:**
Clone the repository, install dependencies using Poetry or pip, and copy `.env.example` to `.env` with your environment variables. Run `streamlit run app.py` for the dashboard, or use the provided Dockerfile for containerized development.

### Q2: What happens if I forget to set a required secret or environment variable?
**A:**
The application performs startup validation and will fail-fast in production if any required secret is missing. In development, you’ll see a warning in the logs.

### Q3: How do I contribute safely?
**A:**
All code must pass pre-commit hooks (linting, secret scanning, doc coverage) and CI/CD checks (tests, coverage, security). Follow the onboarding guide and keep documentation up-to-date.

### Q4: How is error handling managed?
**A:**
Sensitive exceptions are always logged (never silently passed). All error handling is robust and visible for debugging and auditing.

### Q5: How do I update dependencies securely?
**A:**
Use `pip-audit` or `safety` to check for vulnerabilities before updating. All dependency updates are scanned in CI/CD.

## For Auditors & Security Reviewers

### Q1: How is secret management enforced?
**A:**
Critical secrets are required at startup. Secret scanning is enforced in pre-commit and CI/CD. No secrets are hardcoded in code or config files.

### Q2: How is cryptography implemented?
**A:**
All cryptographic operations use secure randomness (`secrets.SystemRandom`). Key management and encryption routines are logged and audited.

### Q3: How is privilege escalation prevented?
**A:**
Containers run as non-root, with a read-only root filesystem. Sensitive files have restricted permissions.

### Q4: How is code coverage and quality enforced?
**A:**
Coverage is enforced at 80%+ in CI/CD. Linting, type-checking, and documentation coverage are all automated.

## For End-Users & Clients

### Q1: How is my data protected?
**A:**
Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Access is authenticated and authorized. Security best practices are followed throughout the stack.

### Q2: What happens if there’s an error or outage?
**A:**
Healthchecks and monitoring are in place. The system is designed to fail-safe and alert operators in case of issues.

### Q3: Who can I contact for support?
**A:**
Contact the CustomerAI support team or engineering leadership for assistance. See the `SUPPORT.md` or project documentation for details.
