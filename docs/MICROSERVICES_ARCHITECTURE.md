# CustomerAI Insights Platform - Microservices Architecture

This document outlines the microservices architecture for the CustomerAI Insights Platform, designed to enhance scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Architecture Overview

The CustomerAI Insights Platform is being refactored from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture. This transition will improve:

- **Scalability**: Individual services can scale independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Failures in one service won't bring down the entire system
- **Development Velocity**: Teams can work on different services independently
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies as appropriate

## Core Microservices

### 1. Authentication Service
- **Responsibility**: Handle user authentication, JWT token generation and validation
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/auth/*`
- **Database**: Dedicated user database
- **Key Technologies**: OAuth 2.0, JWT, Redis for token caching

### 2. Sentiment Analysis Service
- **Responsibility**: Process and analyze customer interactions for sentiment
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/analyze/*`
- **Key Technologies**: NLP models, caching layer for frequent queries

### 3. Response Generation Service
- **Responsibility**: Generate AI-powered responses for customer queries
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/generate/*`
- **Key Technologies**: LLM integration, context management

### 4. Privacy Management Service
- **Responsibility**: Handle PII anonymization and privacy compliance
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/privacy/*`
- **Key Technologies**: PII detection algorithms, encryption

### 5. Fairness Analysis Service
- **Responsibility**: Analyze datasets for bias across demographic groups
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/fairness/*`
- **Key Technologies**: Fairness metrics, statistical analysis

### 6. Human Review Service
- **Responsibility**: Manage the human review workflow for AI-generated content
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/review/*`
- **Database**: Review queue database
- **Key Technologies**: Queue management, notification system

### 7. Analytics Service
- **Responsibility**: Provide dashboard analytics and reporting
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/analytics/*`
- **Database**: Analytics data warehouse
- **Key Technologies**: Data aggregation, time-series analysis

### 8. AI/ML Service
- **Responsibility**: Handle generative AI, embeddings, and ML operations
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/ai/*`
- **Key Technologies**: Model serving, distributed training

## Inter-Service Communication

### Synchronous Communication
- REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- gRPC for high-performance internal communication

### Asynchronous Communication
- Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for event-driven architecture
- Event topics:
  - `customer.interaction.new`: Triggered when new customer interaction is received
  - `sentiment.analysis.complete`: Triggered when sentiment analysis is completed
  - `response.generation.complete`: Triggered when response generation is completed
  - `review.required`: Triggered when human review is required

## API Gateway

- Single entry point for all client requests
- Handles routing to appropriate microservices
- Implements cross-cutting concerns:
  - Authentication/Authorization
  - Rate limiting
  - Request/Response logging
  - Response caching

## Caching Strategy

- **Distributed Cache** (Redis):
  - JWT tokens
  - Frequently accessed sentiment analysis results
  - User session data
  - AI model responses for common queries

- **Cache Invalidation Strategies**:
  - Time-based expiration
  - Event-based invalidation
  - Version tagging

## Deployment Architecture

- Containerized microservices using Docker
- Orchestration with Kubernetes
- Horizontal scaling based on load metrics
- Blue/Green deployment for zero-downtime updates

## Observability

- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Dashboards (Grafana)
- Health checks and circuit breakers

## Security Considerations

- Service-to-service authentication
- Encrypted communication (TLS)
- Secrets management (Vault/AWS Secrets Manager)
- Regular security scanning and auditing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Set up Kubernetes cluster
- Implement API Gateway
- Establish CI/CD pipelines
- Configure monitoring and logging

### Phase 2: Core Services Migration
- Authentication Service
- Sentiment Analysis Service
- Response Generation Service

### Phase 3: Supporting Services Migration
- Privacy Management Service
- Fairness Analysis Service
- Human Review Service

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Analytics Service
- AI/ML Service
- Enhanced caching and performance optimizations

## Performance Considerations

- Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement request throttling and rate limiting
- Use asynchronous processing for time-consuming tasks

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Service health monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource utilization alerts
- Business KPI dashboards

## Disaster Recovery

- Regular data backups
- Multi-region deployment capability
- Automated failover mechanisms
- Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) definitions
