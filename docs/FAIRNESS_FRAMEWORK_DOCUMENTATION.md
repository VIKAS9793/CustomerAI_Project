# CustomerAI Fairness Framework Documentation

Last Updated: May 6, 2025

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the CustomerAI Fairness Framework, a Python 3.10-based system for ensuring AI fairness and bias mitigation in customer analytics.

## Framework Overview

```python
from src.fairness import BiasDetector, FairnessMitigation
from src.fairness.types import FairnessConfig, FairnessMetrics

# Initialize with configuration
config = FairnessConfig.load()
detector = BiasDetector(config)

# Analyze for bias
metrics: FairnessMetrics = detector.analyze(data)
```

## Key Features

- Comprehensive bias detection across multiple metrics
- Industry-specific fairness configurations
- Memory-efficient processing with pagination
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Human-in-the-loop review integration

## Key Components

The fairness framework consists of several key components, each with its own documentation:

### 1. Bias Detection

The bias detection component analyzes datasets and model outputs for potential bias across protected attributes.

- **Documentation**: [Bias Detection Guide](./bias_detection.md)
- **Key Files**:
  - `src/fairness/bias_detector.py`: Main implementation
  - `tests/unit/test_fairness.py`: Unit tests with examples
  - `examples/bias_detection_example.py`: Example usage

### 2. Fairness Mitigation

The mitigation component provides strategies to reduce or eliminate bias in datasets and models.

- **Documentation**: [Mitigation Strategies Guide](./mitigation_strategies.md)
- **Key Files**:
  - `src/fairness/mitigation.py`: Main implementation
  - `examples/mitigation_example.py`: Example usage
  - `config/fairness_config.json.example`: Configuration options

### 3. Fairness Dashboard

The dashboard component provides interactive visualizations for exploring fairness metrics.

- **Documentation**: [Dashboard User Guide](./dashboard_guide.md)
- **Key Files**:
  - `src/fairness/dashboard.py`: Main implementation
  - `examples/dashboard_example.py`: Example usage

### 4. Configuration System

The configuration system allows for customization of the fairness framework.

- **Documentation**: [Configuration System Guide](./configuration_system.md)
- **Key Files**:
  - `src/config/fairness_config.py`: Configuration manager
  - `config/fairness_config.json.example`: Example configuration
  - `examples/custom_fairness_config.py`: Example customization

## Implementation Guides

### Real-World API Integration

The [Implementation Guide](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) provides detailed instructions for:

1. **Replacing Placeholder APIs**: How to replace placeholder implementations with real APIs
2. **ML Framework Integration**: Integration with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn
3. **Authentication and Security**: Implementing real authentication and security measures
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Setting up proper monitoring and logging

### Industry-Specific Configurations

The framework includes example configurations for different industries:

1. **Financial Services**: Stricter fairness thresholds and significance levels
2. **Healthcare**: Focus on equal opportunity and false negative reduction
3. **Human Resources**: Balanced sampling and disparate impact removal

See the [examples/configs](../examples/configs) directory for industry-specific configuration examples.

## Customization Options

The fairness framework can be customized in several ways:

1. **Configuration File**: Create a JSON file based on the provided template
2. **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables to override specific settings
3. **Direct Code Configuration**: Pass configuration dictionaries to component constructors

See the [Customization Guide](./CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

## Integration with Existing Systems

The fairness framework can be integrated with existing ML pipelines and systems:

1. **ML Pipelines**: Integration with existing training and inference pipelines
2. **Monitoring Systems**: Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring tools
3. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integration with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and other CI/CD systems

See the [Integration Guide](./integration_guide.md) for detailed instructions.
