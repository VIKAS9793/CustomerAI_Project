# CustomerAI Insights Platform - Security Enhancements

This document outlines comprehensive security enhancements for the CustomerAI Insights Platform to protect sensitive customer data, ensure compliance with regulations, and maintain the integrity of AI-powered insights.

## Security Objectives

- Protect customer personally identifiable information (PII)
- Ensure secure authentication and authorization
- Implement defense-in-depth security measures
- Maintain compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Secure AI/ML models and training data
- Establish comprehensive audit trails

## Authentication & Authorization

### Enhanced JWT Implementation

- **Short-lived Access Tokens**: 15-minute expiration
- **Refresh Token Rotation**: New refresh token with each use
- **Token Revocation**: Redis-based blocklist for compromised tokens
- **Claims-based Authorization**: Role and permission claims in JWT payload
- **Signature Algorithm**: RS256 (asymmetric) instead of HS256

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Implementation**: Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)
- **Enforcement**: Required for administrative access
- **Recovery**: Secure account recovery process

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-IP limits
- **API Keys**: For service-to-service communication
- **Request Signing**: HMAC signature for sensitive operations

## Data Protection

### Encryption Strategy

- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data
- **Database Encryption**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- **Field-level Encryption**: For PII and sensitive fields

### PII Handling

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Anonymization**: Irreversible transformation for analytics
- **Pseudonymization**: Replaceable identifiers for operational data
