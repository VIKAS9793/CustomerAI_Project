# CustomerAI Architecture

## System Overview

CustomerAI is a microservices-based platform that uses AI to provide customer insights and analytics. The system is built using Python 3.10 and follows a modular architecture.

## Core Components

### 1. API Gateway
- Handles all incoming requests
- Implements rate limiting
- Provides authentication and authorization
- Routes requests to appropriate services

### 2. Fairness Service
- Implements fairness detection algorithms
- Manages bias detection
- Provides mitigation strategies
- Maintains fairness metrics

### 3. Response Generator
- Processes customer interactions
- Generates appropriate responses
- Implements context-aware responses
- Manages conversation state

### 4. Privacy Service
- Handles data anonymization
- Implements privacy-preserving techniques
- Manages PII handling
- Provides data masking capabilities

## Data Flow

1. **Request Flow**
   ```
   Client -> API Gateway -> Authentication -> Rate Limiter -> Service Router -> Service
   ```

2. **Response Flow**
   ```
   Service -> Service Router -> Response Processor -> API Gateway -> Client
   ```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. Client sends request with API key
2. Gateway validates key
3. Rate limiter checks quota
4. Request is routed to service

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted
- PII is anonymized before processing
- Audit logs are maintained
- Regular security scans are performed

## Deployment Architecture

### Docker Configuration
- Each service runs in its own container
- Healthchecks are implemented
- Logging is centralized
- Configuration is managed via environment variables

### Monitoring
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Alertmanager for notifications
- Log aggregation with ELK stack

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.10
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

### Frontend
- React
- TypeScript
- Redux
- Material-UI

### Infrastructure
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AWS/GCP/Azure
- Prometheus/Grafana

## Scalability Considerations

1. Horizontal Scaling
   - Services can be scaled independently
   - Load balancers distribute traffic
   - State is managed in distributed systems

2. Vertical Scaling
   - Services can be allocated more resources
   - Database can be sharded
   - Cache can be scaled

## Security Considerations

1. Input Validation
   - All inputs are sanitized
   - Rate limiting is implemented
   - API keys are required
   - IP whitelisting is available

2. Data Protection
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Regular security audits
   - Dependency scanning
   - Regular updates

## Future Considerations

1. Additional Services
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Intent Recognition
   - Language Translation

2. Integration Points
   - CRM Systems
   - Marketing Platforms
   - Analytics Tools

3. Performance Improvements
   - Caching strategies
   - Async processing
   - Batch processing

## Development Guidelines

1. Code Style
   - Follow PEP 8
   - Use type hints
   - Write tests
   - Document code

2. Testing
   - Unit tests for all functions
   - Integration tests for services
   - End-to-end tests for flows
   - Performance tests

3. Security
   - Regular security reviews
   - Dependency updates
   - Code scanning
   - Security testing
