# AI Governance Framework

This document outlines the governance framework for responsible AI development and deployment at CustomerAI, based on industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Industry-Aligned Governance Structure

Our AI governance framework is aligned with established standards:

- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)** - Following the National Institute of Standards and Technology's framework for managing AI risks
- **EU AI Act Compliance** - Alignment with the EU's risk-based approach to AI regulation
- **ISO/IEC 42001** - Following emerging standards for AI management systems

## Responsible AI Principles

### 1. Human Oversight and Control

All CustomerAI systems implement human-in-the-loop capabilities following Microsoft's RAI (Responsible AI) practices:

- **Approval Workflows**: Critical AI decisions require human approval
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Low-confidence predictions are routed to human reviewers
- **Override Capabilities**: Human operators can override model decisions at any point
- **Audit Trails**: All human interventions are logged for accountability

### 2. Fairness and Bias Mitigation

Our enhanced fairness framework implements industry-leading practices for bias detection and mitigation:

#### Comprehensive Bias Detection
- **Multiple Fairness Metrics**: Disparate impact, statistical parity, equal opportunity, and predictive parity
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: p-value calculation for reliable bias detection
- **Intersectional Analysis**: Evaluation across multiple protected attributes simultaneously
- **Detailed Fairness Reporting**: Severity-classified findings with actionable insights

#### Interactive Visualization
- **Fairness Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of fairness metrics across protected groups
- **Attribute Distribution Analysis**: Visual representation of dataset balance
- **Temporal Monitoring**: Tracking fairness metrics over time

#### Automated Mitigation Strategies
- **Pre-processing Techniques**:
  - Sample reweighting to balance outcomes across protected groups
  - Balanced dataset creation through stratified resampling
  - Feature transformation to reduce protected attribute correlation
- **Post-processing Adjustments**:
  - Equalized odds post-processing for balanced error rates
  - Calibrated equalized odds for probability adjustments

#### Governance Integration
- **Automated Recommendations**: AI-generated mitigation strategies based on detected bias
- **API-driven Analysis**: Standardized interfaces for fairness evaluation
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated fairness reports for compliance purposes

### 3. Transparency and Explainability

Based on IBM's AI Ethics framework:

- **Model Cards**: Each model has a comprehensive model card following Google's standard
- **Explanation Methods**: SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual explanations for model decisions
- **Confidence Scores**: All predictions include calibrated confidence scores
- **User-Accessible Explanations**: Explanations delivered in accessible language

### 4. Privacy and Security

Aligned with Ant Financial's secure AI practices:

- **Data Minimization**: Models use only necessary data
- **Federated Learning**: Where applicable, models are trained without centralizing data
- **Differential Privacy**: Epsilon values tracked and managed
- **LLM Guardrails**: Advanced prompt protections against jailbreaking and data leakage

### 5. Reliability and Safety

Following AWS and Microsoft Azure's reliability engineering practices:

- **Canary Deployments**: Progressive rollout of model updates
- **Champion/Challenger**: New models compete against benchmarks before deployment
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time monitoring for unexpected model behavior
- **Fallback Systems**: Degradation paths for AI system failures

## Human-in-the-Loop Implementation

Our human-in-the-loop system is modeled after Anthropic's Constitutional AI approach and Salesforce's Einstein implementation:

### Oversight Tiers

1. **Automatic Processing** - High-confidence, low-risk decisions (>95% confidence)
2. **Review Queue** - Medium-confidence or medium-risk decisions (70-95% confidence)
3. **Expert Review** - Low-confidence or high-risk decisions (<70% confidence or high-stakes domain)
4. **Collaborative Development** - New model features developed with domain experts

### Review Process Implementation

- **Slack Integration**: Critical reviews are routed to relevant Slack channels (similar to Confluent's implementation)
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Domain-specific review interfaces for different use cases
- **SLA Tracking**: Time-to-review metrics and escalation paths
- **Continuous Learning**: Reviewer feedback incorporated into model training

## Metrics and Monitoring

Based on LinkedIn's AI operations platform and enhanced with our fairness framework:

- **Model Health**: Drift detection, performance degradation alerts
- **Enhanced Fairness Monitoring**:
  - **Multi-metric Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of disparate impact, statistical parity, and equal opportunity
  - **Statistical Significance**: p-value tracking for all fairness metrics
  - **Intersectional Analysis**: Monitoring across combinations of protected attributes
  - **Temporal Trends**: Tracking fairness metrics over time to detect emerging biases
- **Mitigation Effectiveness**: Measuring impact of applied bias mitigation strategies
- **Business Impact**: Tracking business KPIs affected by model decisions
- **Human Intervention Rate**: Monitoring frequency of human corrections

## Risk Management

Following financial industry standards from JP Morgan's AI/ML risk framework:

- **Risk Register**: Categorized AI risks with mitigation strategies
- **Regular Assessments**: Quarterly risk reviews of all AI systems
- **Incident Response**: Defined procedures for AI system failures or biased outcomes
- **Red Team Testing**: Adversarial testing of models before deployment

## Compliance Documentation

- **Model Risk Documentation**: Following Federal Reserve SR 11-7 guidelines
- **GDPR Documentation**: Data protection impact assessments
- **AI Audit Records**: Documentation for regulatory review
