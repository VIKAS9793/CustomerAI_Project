# Fairness Dashboard Documentation

This document provides comprehensive guidance for using the interactive Fairness Dashboard in the CustomerAI Insights Platform.

## Overview

The Fairness Dashboard is an interactive visualization tool that enables stakeholders to explore, understand, and address bias in AI systems. It provides intuitive visualizations of fairness metrics, detailed analysis of protected attributes, and actionable recommendations for bias mitigation.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Visualizations

The dashboard provides multiple visualization types for fairness metrics:

- **Metric Comparison**: Compare fairness metrics across different protected attributes
- **Attribute Analysis**: Deep dive into specific protected attributes
- **Temporal Trends**: Track fairness metrics over time
- **Distribution Analysis**: Visualize dataset balance across protected groups

### 2. Detailed Fairness Reports

The dashboard generates comprehensive fairness reports including:

- **Overall Fairness Score**: Aggregated measure of fairness across all metrics
- **Bias Detection**: Identification of statistically significant bias
- **Severity Classification**: Categorization of findings by severity (high, medium, low)
- **Statistical Significance**: p-values for all detected biases

### 3. Mitigation Recommendations

Based on detected bias, the dashboard provides:

- **Automated Recommendations**: AI-generated mitigation strategies
- **Strategy Comparison**: Compare effectiveness of different mitigation approaches
- **Implementation Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for applying mitigation strategies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Installation

The Fairness Dashboard is included in the main CustomerAI Insights Platform installation. If you need to install it separately:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Dashboard

To launch the dashboard as a standalone application:

```bash
python -m fairness.dashboard
```

Or to integrate it into your application:

```python
from fairness.dashboard import FairnessDashboard

# Initialize the dashboard
dashboard = FairnessDashboard()

# Load fairness results
dashboard.load_results(results_dict=fairness_results)

# Run the dashboard
dashboard.run_dashboard()
```

## Dashboard Sections

### 1. Fairness Summary

The summary section provides an overview of the fairness analysis:

- **Fairness Score**: Overall fairness score (0-100%)
- **Bias Status**: Whether significant bias was detected
- **Significant Findings**: Number of statistically significant bias findings
- **Dataset Information**: Size, attributes analyzed, and outcomes analyzed

### 2. Detailed Metrics

The detailed metrics section allows exploration of specific fairness metrics:

- **Metric Selection**: Choose which fairness metric to visualize
- **Attribute Filtering**: Filter by specific protected attributes
- **Outcome Filtering**: Filter by specific outcomes
- **Visualization Types**: Bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps

### 3. Attribute Analysis

The attribute analysis section provides deep dives into specific protected attributes:

- **Attribute Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of attribute values
- **Outcome Distribution**: Compare outcomes across attribute values
- **Metric Comparison**: Compare different fairness metrics for the attribute
- **Statistical Significance**: View p-values for detected biases

### 4. Recommendations

The recommendations section provides actionable guidance:

- **Mitigation Strategies**: Recommended strategies for addressing detected bias
- **Implementation Steps**: Step-by-step guidance for applying strategies
- **Expected Impact**: Estimated effect of each strategy on fairness metrics

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing Gender Bias in Customer Satisfaction

1. Upload customer satisfaction data with gender information
2. Select "gender" as the protected attribute
3. Select "satisfaction_score" as the outcome
4. View the disparate impact visualization
5. Drill down into the gender attribute analysis
6. Review recommendations for addressing any detected bias

### Example 2: Monitoring Fairness Over Time

1. Load historical fairness analysis results
2. View the temporal trends visualization
3. Identify any emerging bias patterns
4. Compare effectiveness of previously applied mitigation strategies

### Example 3: Comparing Multiple Protected Attributes

1. Load dataset with multiple protected attributes (age, gender, location)
2. View the metric comparison visualization
3. Identify which attributes show the most significant bias
4. Prioritize mitigation efforts based on severity and statistical significance

## Integration with API

The Fairness Dashboard can be integrated with the Fairness API:

1. Use the API to perform fairness analysis on large datasets
2. Load the analysis results into the dashboard
3. Explore and visualize the results interactively
4. Apply selected mitigation strategies using the API

For more information on the API integration, see the [Fairness API Documentation](FAIRNESS_API.md).

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Representative Data**: Ensure your dataset is representative of the population
- **Complete Attributes**: Include all relevant protected attributes
- **Clean Values**: Standardize attribute values (e.g., consistent gender categories)
- **Sufficient Sample Size**: Ensure adequate samples for each attribute value

### 2. Interpretation

- **Statistical Significance**: Focus on statistically significant findings (p < 0.05)
- **Effect Size**: Consider the magnitude of bias, not just its presence
- **Multiple Metrics**: Examine multiple fairness metrics for a complete picture
- **Context Matters**: Interpret results in the context of your specific domain

### 3. Mitigation

- **Staged Approach**: Apply mitigation strategies incrementally
- **Validate Results**: Re-analyze after applying mitigation
- **Monitor Over Time**: Continuously monitor fairness metrics
- **Document Actions**: Keep records of applied mitigation strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Data**: Ensure all required columns are present in your dataset
2. **Inconsistent Values**: Standardize attribute values before analysis
3. **Small Sample Sizes**: Be cautious of results with small samples for certain groups
4. **Conflicting Metrics**: Different fairness metrics may show conflicting results

### Error Messages

- **"No valid attributes found"**: Check that your protected attributes exist in the dataset
- **"Insufficient data for statistical analysis"**: Increase sample size for reliable results
- **"Error loading results file"**: Ensure the results file is in the correct JSON format

## Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Fairness Metrics

Add custom fairness metrics to the dashboard:

```python
from fairness.dashboard import FairnessDashboard

# Initialize with custom metrics
dashboard = FairnessDashboard()

# Define custom metric function
def my_custom_metric(results):
    # Calculate custom metric
    return custom_metric_value

# Register custom metric
dashboard.register_custom_metric(
    name="My Custom Metric",
    function=my_custom_metric,
    description="Description of my custom fairness metric"
)

# Run dashboard with custom metric
dashboard.run_dashboard()
```

### 2. Export Capabilities

The dashboard supports exporting results in multiple formats:

- **PDF Reports**: Generate comprehensive PDF reports
- **CSV Export**: Export raw metrics data for further analysis
- **JSON Export**: Export structured data for API integration
- **Image Export**: Export visualizations as PNG or SVG

### 3. Collaborative Features

Enable collaboration through:

- **Shared Links**: Generate shareable links to specific dashboard views
- **Comments**: Add comments to specific findings
- **Action Items**: Assign and track mitigation actions
- **Version History**: Track changes in fairness metrics over time

## Conclusion

The Fairness Dashboard is a powerful tool for understanding and addressing bias in AI systems. By providing intuitive visualizations, detailed analysis, and actionable recommendations, it enables organizations to build more fair and ethical AI applications.
