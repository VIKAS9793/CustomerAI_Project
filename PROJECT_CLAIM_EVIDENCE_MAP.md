## 2. Security and Secret Management
- **Claim:** All secrets are required at startup and secret scanning is enforced.
- **Evidence:**
  - `app.py`: Startup validation for required secrets (`JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, etc.).

  - Example configs for finance/healthcare in `examples/` or `docs/` (see customization guide).
  - Documentation: Customization guide and config options (see `README.md`, `docs/`).

---

## 4. Testing, CI/CD, and Code Quality
- **Claim:** Automated tests, linting, and code quality checks are enforced.
- **Evidence:**
  - `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for fairness components.
  - `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`: Multi-stage pipeline with linting, type checking, formatting, and test coverage.
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Hooks for linting, doc coverage, and secret scanning.

## 5. Containerization & Operational Readiness
- **Claim:** Dockerized, non-root execution, resource limits, and monitoring are implemented.
- **Evidence:**
  - `Dockerfile`: Non-root user, resource limits, healthcheck.

## 7. Real-World Test Cases & Edge Handling
- **Claim:** Framework handles edge cases and large datasets reliably.
- **Evidence:**
  - `tests/`: Edge case tests for empty datasets, missing attributes, and large files.
  - `src/fairness/dashboard.py`: Memory-efficient pagination and error handling.
