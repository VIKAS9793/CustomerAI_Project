## Development Setup

This section will help you set up a development environment.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* pip
* Git
* Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Local Development

2. Clone your fork locally:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/customerai-insights.git
    cd customerai-insights
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
    ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
    ```
    pre-commit install
    ```

5. Create a branch for your feature or bugfix:
    ```
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

6. Make your changes and write tests for your changes
7. Run tests to ensure all pass:
    ```
    pytest
    ```

8. Run linters and formatters:
    ```
    black .
    flake8
    mypy src
    ```

9. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message:
    ```
    git commit -m "Description of your changes"
    ```

10. Push your branch to GitHub:
    ```
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

11. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * 🎨 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * 🐎 `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * 🚱 `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
    * 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * 🔥 `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * 💚 `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * ✅ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * 🔒 `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * ⬆️ `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * ⬇️ `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### Python Style Guide

* All Python code should adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
* Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
* Use type hints according to [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
* Use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for documentation
* Reference code with backticks: `like this`
* For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks with language specification:
    ```python
    def example_function():
        """This is an example function."""
        return True
    ```
* Follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for docstrings

## Testing Guidelines

* Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
* Aim for high test coverage (at least 80%)
* Use pytest for writing and running tests
* Organize tests to match the structure of the main code
* Use descriptive test function names (test_what_it_does_when_condition)
* Write both unit tests and integration tests
